# One-Time Link Generator

This project allows users to create one-time links to securely share content. Once the link is accessed, it becomes invalid, ensuring that content is only viewable once.

A live version of this project [can be found here!](https://one-time-link.vercel.app/)

This project is released as open source to promote transparency and accessibility. I want others to benefit from the work Iâ€™ve done, whether it's for learning purposes or for enhancing their own projects.
