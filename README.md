# One-Time Link Generator

This project allows users to create one-time links to securely share content. Once the link is accessed, it becomes invalid, ensuring that content is only viewable once.

This project is released as open source to promote transparency and accessibility. I want others to benefit from the work Iâ€™ve done, whether it's for learning purposes or for enhancing their own projects.
